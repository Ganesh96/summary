# [00:00:01](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1s) Introduction

This video explores the complexity of the brain and how it creates our perception of reality. The speakers discuss illusions, the relationship between the brain and mind, and the ultimate mystery of how matter becomes thought.

## [00:00:08](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=8s) Complexity of the Brain

- The brain is one of the most complex objects in the universe.
- There are more connections in your brain than there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy.
- Our brains have about 10,000 galaxies' worth of neuronal connections.

## [00:00:40](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=40s) Perception of Reality

- The world pours itself into our minds through our senses.
- What we see, hear, and feel is not necessarily real.
- Illusions reveal that our perception may not be accurate.

## [00:01:36](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=96s) Sense of Self as an Illusion

- Our sense of self is an illusion like everything else.
- We may be the biggest illusion of all.

## [00:02:44](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=164s) Heather Berlin's Journey to Understand Her Brain

Heather Berlin became a neuroscientist and psychologist to understand how the world gets inside our heads.

## [00:04:34](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=274s) Imagine Being a Brain Sealed Inside Your Skull

- As a brain sealed inside your skull, there's no light or sound.
- You're a massive collection of billions and billions
of cells living in a weird pond that is entirely devoid of external stimuli.

# [00:05:20](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=320s) Conclusion

The brain's complexity and the mystery of how it creates our perception of reality continue to fascinate scientists and researchers. Understanding the brain may be one of the highest human achievements to date.

# [00:04:58](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=298s) Perceptions and Memories

Our perceptions and memories of the world originate in our brains. All brains, from tiny fish to enormous elephants, contain microscopic cells called neurons that translate input from the external world into electrochemical signals that the organism can use to act.

## [00:05:03](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=303s) Neurons Transform Reality

As neurons process sensory signals, they create an edited version of reality, even on the most basic level. Neurons transform reality by competing with each other. When a creature touches, smells, sees or hears something, its sensory neurons fire; some a little, some a lot depending on where the physical signal is strongest. But follow those signals down towards its brain and you'll see that the weaker ones get stamped out.

## [00:06:27](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=387s) Illusions are Important

Illusions are important because of this discrepancy between objective reality and subjective perception. We can use these illusions as a handle to try to understand what the brain is doing all the time.

## [00:07:50](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=470s) Human Vision

Human vision is like seeing through a tiny pinhole in your eye. You actually only see detail in about one percent of your visual field because only a tiny portion of the world can be processed in detail by the retina. It's almost all completely made up in your brain based on assumptions and models of how the world works and just a tiny bit of high-quality visual information.

## [00:08:52](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=532s) Continuous Perception

It feels like we're seeing the whole world in 20/20 vision, but it's almost all completely made up in our brain based on assumptions and models of how the world works and just a tiny bit of high-quality visual information.

# [0:09:05](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=545s) How Our Eyes Work

This video explains how our eyes work and how our brain processes visual information.

- The display of letters is tied to eye movements.
- Eye movements program what part of the high-quality piece of visual real estate we're going to put where and at what time.
- The human eye moves about three times per second. Without these movements, we'd be basically blind.
- Our brains sample tiny pieces of the world and fill in the rest constantly, all the time.
- The optic nerve connects your eye to your brain, creating a blind spot near the center of your visual field. However, you don't experience the blind spot because the brain samples the area near it and fills in the gap with its best guess.

## [0:10:10](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=610s) Blocking What You Can See

This section demonstrates how blocking what you can see works.

- In this demonstration, wherever you happen to look, you have high-quality image processing happening, but it's blurry in the surround.
- This kind of represents exactly what your visual system looks like all the time anyway.
- If we didn't have eye movements and we just wanted to see the entire world, we'd need to have our retinas see everything in very high quality. Our brains would be 600 times bigger.
 
## [0:11:19](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=679s) How Your Brain Really Sees The World

This section explains how your brain really sees the world.

- Your eyes sample tiny pieces of the world and fill in the rest-- constantly, all the time.
- We represent one percent of it at any particular moment in time. So it's a constant updating between what I see with, versus what I remember, versus what I expect.

# [0:12:50](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=770s) The Brain's Edited Reality

In this section, the speakers discuss how our brain processes information and constructs a simulation of the world around us. They use the example of driving a car to illustrate how we only need to pay attention to a small percentage of the information in order to function effectively.

- Our brain constructs a grand simulation of the visual world around us based on a very tiny amount of information.
- This edited reality serves us well because we don't have to pay attention to everything at once.
- By understanding how our senses work, we can get a peek behind the curtain and see what our brain is really up to outside of our awareness.

## [0:13:49](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=829s) The Dress Debate

The speakers discuss the viral phenomenon surrounding "the dress" and how it illustrates how color perception works in the brain.

- "The dress" caused massive arguments and even existential crises over whether it was white and gold or blue and black.
- Vision scientists explain that context plays a huge role in color perception, as demonstrated by different versions of "the dress" placed in different settings.
- Color takes place in the brain, not in the external world.

## [0:16:26](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=986s) Illusion with Cars

The speakers present an illusion involving four cars that demonstrates how color perception is subjective and takes place in the brain.

- The speaker shows four cars that appear to be different colors depending on their surroundings.
- This illusion demonstrates that color perception is subjective and depends on context.

# [0:16:41](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1001s) The Illusion of Color

This video explains how color is an interpretation of our brain and not a property of light. It also explores how different animals see color differently.

- Pixels that appear to be different colors are actually the same gray.
- Light enters our eyes and bounces off objects, with each wavelength corresponding to a different color.
- Our brains interpret the reflective properties of objects and the wavelengths of light hitting them to create color.
- The cones in our eyes are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, but it's not until the signal reaches V4 in our brain that we perceive color.
- Our brains compensate for changes in lighting conditions so that objects appear consistent in color.
- Different animals have evolved to see colors suited to their needs.

## [0:19:39](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1179s) The Dress

The video discusses why people perceive the dress as either black and blue or white and gold.

- People's perception of the dress depends on their brain's assumptions about lighting conditions.
- Spending more time indoors under yellow artificial light makes people more likely to see the dress as black and blue, while spending more time in natural bluer light makes people more likely to see it as white and gold.
- The actual color of the dress is blue and black.

# [00:21:07](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1267s) Illusions and Perception

This video explores how our brain creates our perception of the world around us. It shows that illusions can give us a ringside seat to watch how the brain works, not just in the visual domain but also in the auditory domain.

- Our perception of the external world is much less objective than we'd like to believe.
- When your brain encounters uncertainty, it fills in gaps with its best guess.
- Most of us literally hear what we want to hear.
- The audio file "yanny or laurel" is an ambiguous signal made up of both high and low frequencies, which explains why some people hear one word while others hear another.
- The brain's job is not to perceive the world accurately but rather to predict what happens next.

## [00:22:49](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1369s) Perception and Reality

The video continues exploring how our perception of reality is filtered through our brains.

- Our mind is a perception of the world that's being filtered through a bunch of saltwater sacks of proteins and electrochemical signals, which can't possibly be making completely accurate determinations of what's actually in the outside world.
- Some neuroscientists would say that it's not your brain's job to perceive the world accurately but rather to predict what happens next.
- To a certain extent, you see what you expect to see: a predicted path of motion.

## [00:24:17](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1457s) Predicting What Happens Next

The video concludes by discussing how our brains are predicting machines.

- The brain predicts what happens next based on given circumstances at any moment.

# [00:25:18](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1518s) Calibrating the Brain's Perceptual Predictions

This video explores how the brain's perceptual predictions are calibrated and fine-tuned to remain tied to reality. The brain has evolved to look for signals of potential danger, with pain being one of the most important. However, sometimes pain can be an illusion, as demonstrated by a thermal grill that confuses the brain into interpreting cold and warmth signals as pain.

- The brain's perceptual predictions are calibrated and fine-tuned to remain tied to reality.
- Pain is an important signal of potential danger.
- A thermal grill can confuse the brain into interpreting cold and warmth signals as pain.

## [00:26:38](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1598s) Understanding Pain Perception

Pain is a construct of the mind, but it is still critical for survival. It serves as a learning mechanism for children, teaching them what behaviors are safe and which ones could cause bodily harm. Mutations in certain proteins can make people completely insensitive to pain, leading them to engage in risky behavior.

- Pain is a construct of the mind but critical for survival.
- Pain serves as a learning mechanism for children.
- Mutations in certain proteins can make people completely insensitive to pain.

## [00:28:11](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1691s) Pain Is Constructed by the Brain

Pain is constructed by the brain based on sensory information from our bodies. Illusions like those created by the thermal grill reveal that our perception of things isn't necessarily how they actually are. While pain may be a construct, it is still essential for survival.

- Pain is constructed by the brain based on sensory information from our bodies.
- Illusions reveal that our perception of things isn't necessarily how they actually are.
- Pain is still essential for survival.

# [00:29:38](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1778s) The Brain's Model of Reality

This video discusses how the brain creates a model of reality based on limited information and how this relates to consciousness.

- The brain does not reconstruct the world verbatim, but rather uses limited information to create a grand model of the world.
- Illusions are shortcuts that make us faster and more efficient with less resources.
- Based on snippets of information, we build a complex simulation of reality which is what we call consciousness.

## [00:30:24](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1824s) Consciousness as Internal Experience

The video explains how neuroscientists think about consciousness as internal experience.

- Consciousness is just internal experience. It feels like something to see the color red, taste a strawberry or hear thunder.
- We are conscious creatures and our most central feature is that we have experiences.
- When we open our eyes, it's not just sophisticated processing of visual information but an experience.

## [00:32:06](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=1926s) Clues from Patients with Damaged Brains

The video explores how patients with damaged brains provide valuable clues about the role different brain regions play in creating consciousness.

- Patients who have had part of their brain damaged can provide valuable information about the role different brain regions play in creating consciousness.
- By piecing together what was lost after damage to various parts of the brain, scientists can appreciate the role these regions play in creating consciousness.
- A patient who had a stroke affecting her visual field provides an example of blindsight where eye movements compensate for total blind spots.

# [00:33:42](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2022s) Eye-tracking and Blind Spots

In this section, the team uses an eye-tracking system called EyeLink to ensure that the patient does not move her eyes. The patient is asked to focus on a center spot and identify whether dots inside a circle are moving left or right. Even though she says she doesn't see anything in her blind spot, she gets it right more often than not.

- EyeLink is used to track eye movements
- Patient focuses on center spot and identifies dot movement
- Patient gets it right even though she says she doesn't see anything in her blind spot

## [00:34:50](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2090s) Testing Blind Spot Perception

The team tests the patient's ability to perceive objects in her blind spot by placing a miniature screwdriver there. Even though the patient says she sees nothing, she correctly identifies the tool when asked to choose from several options.

- Miniature screwdriver placed in blind spot
- Patient correctly identifies tool even though she says she sees nothing

## [00:35:30](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2130s) Perception vs Conscious Experience

The team discusses how perception can be separate from conscious experience based on their observations of patients like this one. They wonder why we have consciousness at all if someone can still use visual information without awareness of it.

- Perception can be separate from conscious experience
- Team wonders why we have consciousness if someone can use visual information without awareness of it

## [00:36:40](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2200s) Babies and Consciousness

The team discusses how babies are born conscious and take in information from the time they are born. They make rational choices about what they learn and form memories of their surroundings, parents, and important relationships.

- Babies are born conscious and take in information
- Babies make rational choices and form memories

# [00:37:33](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2253s) Toddler's Brain vs Adult's Brain

This section discusses the differences between a toddler's brain and an adult's brain. 

- A two-year-old's brain has about two quadrillion synapses, while an adult's brain has half that number.
- The child's brain is like back country roads with little, inefficient roads connecting many different places. 
- The adult brain is more like superhighways that get you from one place to another quickly but don't connect as many different places.

# [00:38:20](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2300s) Efficiency of the Adult Brain

This section explains how the adult brain becomes more efficient over time.

- As we age, we strengthen connections that are useful to us and prune the rest.
- We get rid of neurons we don't need, resulting in a lean machine that does certain things very well.

# [00:38:53](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2333s) Consciousness in Children vs Adults

This section discusses how consciousness differs between children and adults.

- Children have a floodlight-like consciousness where nearly everything is illuminated.
- Adults have a bright spotlight-like consciousness where only one thing is illuminated at a time.
- Consciousness may be like an amplifier, boosting important signals over noise.

# [00:39:30](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2370s) Mapping Conscious Perception

This section explains how neuroscientists use FMRI to map conscious perception in the brain.

- FMRI takes pictures of the brain while it's doing something to map where blood flow is in high demand.
- Neuroscientists flash a word on a screen for about 30 milliseconds to find the threshold where people consciously see the image.
- When people consciously see the image, a suite of different parts of the brain shows a surge in activity, including the parietal cortex, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex.

# [0:41:10](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2470s) Communication Between Brain Regions

This section discusses how communication between brain regions is the signature of consciousness. The discovery could have real-world applications in matters of life and death, but it would take one more step: figuring out how to measure consciousness.

- Conscious perception involves broadcasting information to the rest of the brain.
- Communication between brain regions is the signature of consciousness.
- Discovering how to measure consciousness could transform treatment for people with brain injuries.

# [0:42:03](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2523s) Measuring Consciousness

This section discusses a new technique being tested by Brian Edlow's team at Mass. General Hospital that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure consciousness.

- A new technique using TMS and EEG is being tested to determine if an unresponsive patient is conscious or not.
- The TMS pulse stimulates the brain, while electrical ripples emanating from that pulse represent waves in a lake.
- In conscious people, even those who appear unresponsive, their brain waves spread all over the brain and become more complex.
- This complexity is a signature or marker of consciousness.
- Studies have enabled scientists to develop a complexity scale where a score above a certain threshold means you are conscious or have the capacity for consciousness.

# [0:44:01](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2641s) Complexity Scale

This section further explains the complexity scale developed by scientists studying patients in various states from deep sleep to anesthesia to coma.

- The way different brain areas speak to each other is a signature or marker of consciousness.
- Scientists have developed a complexity scale based on studies of hundreds of patients in various states.
- A score above a certain threshold means you are conscious or have the capacity for consciousness.
- Multiple studies have shown that 15% to 20% of patients who appear unresponsive, but score above the threshold on the complexity scale, are actually conscious.

# [00:45:10](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2710s) Can Neuroscience Help Us Understand Consciousness?

This video explores the mysteries of consciousness and memory. It discusses how neuroscience is making progress in understanding consciousness, but there is still much to learn.

- Families make decisions about life-sustaining therapy based on a patient's current level of consciousness and potential for future recovery.
- The problem of consciousness is starting to be solved, but it's only the beginning.
- Memories are the cornerstone of our identities, but they have a shaky foundation because they constantly change.
- Every time you remember something, you add more noise to it, making it more false over time.
- Recent experiments suggest that reconsolidation is likely a mechanism in human brains as well because certain drugs known to disrupt reconsolidation have been shown to alter human memories.

## [00:46:31](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2791s) Memory Is a Construction

- The stories we tell ourselves or what we consider our memory is a construction. We create these representations.
- Memories are dynamic and constantly changing. You're living a revision of the story of your life constantly.
- The more often we recall things, the less objectively accurate our memories become.

## [00:47:24](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2844s) Reconsolidation

- Whenever you retrieve a memory, it goes back to an unstable state called reconsolidation.
- For the memory to return to long-term storage, the connections between neurons actually have to get rebuilt.
- Certain drugs known to disrupt reconsolidation have been shown to alter human memories.

## [00:48:45](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2925s) How Do We Know What's Real?

- Memories may not be as they originally happened, which could be a scary thought because then who are we?
- If you think about it as something more liberating, it can help you recognize that some memories don't matter as much as we think they do.

# [0:49:18](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=2958s) Perception of Self

In this section, the speakers discuss how our sense of self is dynamic and built to serve us in the present. They also talk about how our experience of self is a construction at different levels and that the brain weaves together a story to make predictions.

- Our sense of self is dynamic and built to serve us in the present.
- The brain constructs our experience of self at different levels.
- The brain weaves together a story to make predictions.

## [0:50:02](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=3002s) Brain's Perception of Reality

The speakers discuss how the brain perceives reality in the service of survival, not accuracy. They also talk about how our world is a construction built on bits of sensory information woven together with memory to create a conscious experience.

- The brain perceives reality in the service of survival, not accuracy.
- Our world is a construction built on bits of sensory information woven together with memory to create a conscious experience.

## [0:51:16](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=3076s) Understanding Ourselves

The speakers discuss how understanding that we rise from an organization of matter can be liberating and humbling. They also talk about how all aspects of our lives are inscribed in our brains.

- Understanding that we rise from an organization of matter can be liberating and humbling.
- All aspects of our lives are inscribed in our brains.

## [0:51:43](https://youtu.be/HU6LfXNeQM4?t=3103s) Neural Computation

The speaker wonders how spatial and temporal patterns of electrical signals passing between cells in our brains make us who we are. They also talk about how asking that question is worth keeping going for.

- Spatial and temporal patterns of electrical signals passing between cells in our brains make us who we are.
- Asking questions about neural computation is worth pursuing.
