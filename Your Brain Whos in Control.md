This video explores the mysteries of the brain and what is really driving our decisions. The brain is responsible for all facets of our personality, everything we think and feel.

- The brain is the biggest mystery in science today.
- Our unconscious brain controls a large fraction of what's happening in our brains.
- What exactly is going on in your unconscious brain?

# [00:00:31](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=31s) Life is not scripted

Our lives are unscripted, and we make choices that we didn't know we would be making. 

- We do unscripted things all day long that we didn't know we would be doing.
- Find a word that has some meaning for you.
- Representation.

# [00:00:50](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=50s) Who's in control?

We might feel like we're in control, but our brains may have other ideas. 

- This idea that we're in control of our actions seems critical to our sense of identity.
- The brain produces an illusion that there's a single person inside our skulls.
- For every Pinocchio, there's always someone kind of pulling the strings behind the scenes.

# [00:01:25](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=85s) Your Brain

Your personality, morality, memory, language are all up there in your brain. Traumatic events can change people.

- Almost 90 billion neurons make up the human brain.
- Your personality and morality are located within your brain.
- Traumatic events can change people.

# [00:02:06](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=126s) The Illusion of Control

We often feel like we're in control, but our brains may have other ideas. 

- We make decisions that we think are crystal-clear, but then change our minds.
- Our brains contain multitudes and are a complex and intricate three-pound piece of matter.
- There are important unconscious processes in your brain that you're not aware of.

Sleepwalking is a common phenomenon where people walk

# [00:04:40](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=280s) Walking and Sleepwalking

This video explores how the brain controls walking and sleepwalking. It shows that walking is a complex behavior that we do without thinking about it, while sleepwalking involves some parts of the brain staying asleep while others are awake.

## [00:06:12](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=372s) Brain Waves During Sleepwalking

During sleepwalking, everything looks good on the surface, but there is a buildup of slow wave activity in the brain. One part of the brain stays in slow-wave sleep, making it hard to wake up, while other parts become active without engaging the prefrontal cortex responsible for deliberate choices and self-awareness.

## [00:07:27](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=447s) Unconscious Decision Making

Experiences of sleepwalking reveal that being conscious is not an all-or-none situation. Our unconscious makes a lot of everyday decisions for us, such as regulating our heart rate and temperature, and deciding when to take the food in our stomach and move it down into our gut.

# [0:08:21](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=501s) Brain Activity During Anesthesia

This video explores what happens to brain activity when a person undergoes anesthesia. The anesthesiologist's goal is to render the patient unconscious with special drugs, so they don't feel pain or remember anything that's occurring during surgery.

- Sleepwalking can cause mischief in the brain regions that control movement, vision, and breathing.
- Anesthetics remove conscious experience and consciousness comes in degrees.
- When under general anesthesia, we lose consciousness in a more profound way than when we are asleep.

## [0:09:12](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=552s) Measuring Consciousness

Neuroscientist Emery Brown measures the line that separates being conscious from being unconscious using a device called an E.E.G., which detects electrical activity in the brain.

- Brain waves are measured by their frequency and amplitude.
- When someone is awake, their brain wave activity is diverse and dynamic.
- When anesthesia drugs hit the brain, the activity is dramatically reduced to dull, slow-rolling brain waves.

## [0:11:05](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=665s) Altering Brain Communication

The drugs used during anesthesia alter how different parts of the brain communicate with each other. This alteration makes someone unconscious.

- If you alter how parts of the brain communicate sufficiently, you can make someone unconscious.
- The drugs used during anesthesia alter how various parts of the brain communicate.

# [0:12:25](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=745s) Thalamus and Consciousness

This section discusses the role of the thalamus in processing information and how it is a central actor in all types of information processing. The thalamus is so important that if one brain center were to be removed to make someone unconscious, it would probably be the thalamus.

- Thalamus is a central way station for all sorts of information processing
- Auditory, visual, and pain information goes through there
- If one brain center were to be removed to make someone unconscious, it would probably be the thalamus

## [0:12:46](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=766s) Waking Up from Anesthesia

After surgery, the medical team tapers off anesthesia drugs and monitors EEG readings to determine when a patient is waking up. Consciousness involves active cognitive processing and integration of information.

- After surgery, anesthesia drugs are tapered off
- EEG readings are monitored to determine when a patient is waking up
- Consciousness involves active cognitive processing and integration of information

## [0:13:21](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=801s) Understanding Consciousness

Consciousness can interact with the physical world like we can. However, we still don't understand how any specific set of neurons working together produces consciousness. Anesthesia changes consciousness by preventing messages from getting through in a way that makes for our conscious experience.

## [0:14:14](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=854s) The Two Hemispheres of the Brain

The human brain contains two sides, the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, which are connected by a big bundle of fibers called the corpus callosum. For some people with epilepsy, a seizure in one hemisphere can quickly spread to the other by way of the corpus callosum. Split-brain surgery has led to research into how the two hemispheres function.

- They are connected by a big bundle of

# [0:16:19](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=979s) Introduction

In this video, we learn about split-brain patients and how their two hemispheres work independently from one another. The researchers conducted tests to explore this phenomenon.

- Split-brain patients have had their corpus callosum severed, which is the highway that communicates information between the two hemispheres of the brain.
- Each hemisphere controls different functions in the body and has its own unique abilities.

## [0:16:36](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=996s) Motor Commands

The motor commands in one hemisphere interfere with the motor commands in the other hemisphere.

- It is difficult for split-brain patients to draw two different things at the same time because each hand is controlled by a different hemisphere.
- For someone whose hemispheres are disconnected, there's no interference. It's almost as if there's one mind controlling the left hand and a completely different mind controlling the right hand.

## [0:17:29](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=1049s) Visual Field

Only half of your visual field goes to each side of the brain.

- When you're looking straight ahead, everything to the left side of that space goes only to the right hemisphere. And vice versa for everything on the right side.
- This means that each hemisphere processes different parts of what you see.

## [0:17:55](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=1075s) Language and Speech Centers

The left part of your brain is where your language and speech centers are located.

- This enables you to talk, understand language, and more.
- The right side of your brain is very important in evaluating emotions and visual space.

## [0:18:26](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=1106s) Corpus Callosum

The corpus callosum is the pathway that transfers information between the two hemispheres.

- When it's cut, each hemisphere can't communicate with the other.
- This means that split-brain patients may not be able to talk about or even be aware of certain things they see or experience.

Split-brain

# [0:20:10](https://youtu.be/yQ6VOOd73MA?t=1210s) The Split-Brain Phenomenon

This video explores the split-brain phenomenon, where the two hemispheres of the brain can operate independently. The left hemisphere is responsible for language and speech, while the right hemisphere is responsible for visual and spatial processing.

- The only way to know if something has registered in the right hemisphere is if the person can write it out with their left hand.
- During surgery, a word "Texas" was flashed to only his right hemisphere which he drew upside down
